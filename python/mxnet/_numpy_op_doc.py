def _np_reshape(a, newshape, order='C'):
    """Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'
        may be added in the future.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        It will be always a copy of the original array. This behavior is different
        from the official NumPy package where views of the original array may be
        generated.

    --------
    ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.

def _np_ones_like(a):
    """Return an array of ones with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of ones with the same shape and type as `a`.

def _np_zeros_like(a):
    """Return an array of zeros with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of zeros with the same shape and type as `a`.

def _np_repeat(a, repeats, axis=None):
    """Repeat elements of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the
        flattened input array, and return a flat output array.

    Returns
    -------
    repeated_array : ndarray
        Output array which has the same shape as `a`, except along
        the given axis.
